- [API Services](/docs/api-services.md) - API services pattern for making API calls

## Component Organization

The project follows a structured approach to component organization:

### UI Components (`/src/components/ui/`)
Reusable, presentational components that don't contain business logic:
- **Button** - Versatile button component with variants
- **LoadingSpinner** - Animated loading indicator
- (Add more UI components as they're created)

### Feature Components (`/src/components/`)
Feature-specific components that may contain business logic and compose multiple UI components:
- **ThemeToggle** - Component for switching between light/dark themes
- (Add more feature components as they're created)

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Building for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### When to Create a New UI Component
1. The component is purely presentational
2. It will be reused in multiple places
3. It doesn't contain business logic
4. It accepts props to customize its appearance/behavior

### When to Create a Feature Component
1. The component is specific to a feature/page
2. It combines multiple UI components
3. It contains business logic
4. It manages state or side effects
